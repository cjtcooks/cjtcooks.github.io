## Blog Post Instructions
- Upload all image files to the image folder by doing a git add and push. We will be linking the associated images in markdown when writing the blog post.
- Create a file in the `_posts` folder with the naming convention: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-this-is-my-title.md` (jekyll parses this naming convention to display the title of the recipe in the main page).
- Write!
